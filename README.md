## Setting Up The Theme

To get started you will need to have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and some gems on your system. I will describe the install process on OS X.

* Make sure you have the [Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action) for [Xcode](http://developer.apple.com/xcode) on your system.
* Install Ruby using the [RVM](https://rvm.io).
* Install [Bundler](http://bundler.io).

### In Your Terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nextbase/middleman-tea.git
cd middleman-tea
bundle install
middleman
```
